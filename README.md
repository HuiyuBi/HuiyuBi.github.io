<h3> About me </h3>

<p>My name is Huiyu Bi. I am a graduate student in Statistics at UC Davis. I also have received a bachelor‘s degree in Statistics at East China Normal University in 2015.<p>

<p>I am interested in data analysis and proficient in R, Python, C and Matlab. Moreover, I am skillful at data manipulation with MySQL. So I want to find a job as a data analyst or data scientist.</p>

<h3> My projects </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong> Yelp Data Visualization and Analysis </strong>
<br>
<p>Motivation: 
   As we all know, America is a country full of diversive culture. People from all over the world come here to  
   work,study and live. Among different elements, food is one of the most interesting topics we want to discover 
   since it is so deeply involved in our daily life. On a large scale, we are interested in the spatial
   distribution of number of restaurants in different states. Meanwhile, understanding restaurant’s price, 
   rating, number of reviews and their kinds’ distribution will give us a rough idea about our own choice of 
   food. As we go further in the discovery of restaurants, we expect we can find out connection between them by 
   their kinds.</p>
