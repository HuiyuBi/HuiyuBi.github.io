<h3> ABOUT ME </h3>

<p>My name is Huiyu Bi. I am a graduate student in Statistics at UC Davis. I also have received a bachelor‘s degree in Statistics at East China Normal University in 2015.<p>

<p>I am interested in data analysis and proficient in R, Python, C and Matlab. Moreover, I am skillful at data manipulation with MySQL. So I want to find a job as a data analyst or data scientist.</p>

<li><a href="141B_project/index.html"><strong>Yelp Data Visualization and Analysis</strong></a>(<a href="https://github.com/miaoelenawang/STA-141B-Final-Project">github for this project</a>)
<br>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> <br>
   As we all know, America is a country full of diversive culture. People from all over the world come here to  
   work,study and live. Among different elements, food is one of the most interesting topics we want to discover 
   since it is so deeply involved in our daily life. On a large scale, we are interested in the spatial
   distribution of number of restaurants in different states. Meanwhile, understanding restaurant’s price, 
   rating, number of reviews and their kinds’ distribution will give us a rough idea about our own choice of 
   food. As we go further in the discovery of restaurants, we expect we can find out connection between them by 
   their kinds.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Collection and Processing:</strong><br>
We scrap the Yelp website pages to get the data. The total number of pages we scrap is over 20000. After getting the data from webpage, we first reformat some of the results. For instance, we treat reviews as numeric value and price as factors. Also we ignore the records with missing value. Finally we stack all those variables we got to be a dataframe.

<strong>Data Exploration: </strong><br>
1. Descriptive Statistics <br>
2. Network Analysis
</p>

<p>
<strong>Future Improvement:</strong><br>
1. During web scraping, we divide a city into smaller sub-areas to avoid records lost. But that still limit our
ability to get the data when subareas has more than 1000 records. <br>
2. For now, we only obtain records from three cities. In the future, in order to get a more clearer picture of
information we get, we need to collect more data.<br>
3. This time, the goal for this project is data visualization. But this dataset is also good for building a
recommendation system and so on. We can continue exploring that. <br>

<li><strong>Classify User’s Rating Based on IMDb Data</strong>
<br>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
The Internet Movie Database (abbreviated IMDb) is an online database of information related to films, television
programs and video games, including cast, production crew, fictional characters, biographies, plot summaries, 
trivia and reviews. In this project, we tried to use machine learning methods to conduct sentimental analysis of 
a user’s polar rating for a particular movie based on his/her comment for this movie. We also innovatively 
combined the movie feature variables to predict the user’s attitude, and it is proved to be a successful
supplement for the sentimental analysis. In order to get a better classifier, we conducted attempts at two 
layers: to find the best predictor variables combination which has the best prediction performance and to find 
the best classification model to make the most accurate prediction.
