            Our goal is to help business owners decide the location at which they can start or expand a business, set the right price and determine the attributes such as Wifi and Parking to improve the business and thus attract more customers.</p>
            <p>
            We scrap more than 20000 pages at Yelp website to get the data and focus on interative visualization with Bokeh, plotly and folium to analyze. Also statistical analysis for hypothesis testing are carried on to determine the attributes.</p>

        <p>
        Our project can help a movie company to predict a movie's rating before the official release. For some movies that are low budget or uncommon, the company usually will have the test screening to obtain customers' comments for this movie.</p>
        <p> 
        In this project, we use machine learning methods to conduct sentimental analysis of a user’s polar rating for this movie based on his/her comment. We also innovatively combine the movie feature variables, like runtime, director and actors to predict the user’s attitude. Having a rough idea of the movie's reputation, the company can improve the marketing strategy to increase the box office revenue.</p>
