    <h3>About me.</h3>
    
        <div id="me">
        <p>My name is Huiyu Bi, a graduate student in Statistics at UC Davis. I also received a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics at East China Normal University in 2015. Now I am looking for a position of data analyst.<p>
                
        <p>Equipped with 6 years' study in Statistics, I have a deep understanding of statistical theories and methods such as hypothesis testing, linear regression and ANOVA. Moreover, I am proficient in data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization with R, Python and Matlab and data manipulation with MySQL. Also I am familiar with C. </p>

            Jan. 2017-Present, Davis, CA
            <br>
            <p>
            Our goal is to help business owners decide the location at which they can start or expand a business, set the right price and determine the attributes such as Wifi and Parking to improve the business and thus attract more customers.</p>
            <p>
            We scrap more than 20000 pages at Yelp website to get the data and focus on interactive visualization with Bokeh, plotly and folium to analyze. Also statistical analysis for hypothesis testing are carried on to determine the attributes.</p>

         Mar. 2016-Jun. 2016, Davis, CA
        <p>
        Our project can help a movie company to predict a movie's rating before the official release. For some movies that are low budget or uncommon, the company usually will have the test screening to obtain customers' comments for this movie.</p>
        <p> 
        In this project, we use machine learning methods to conduct sentimental analysis of a user’s polar rating for this movie based on his/her comment. We also innovatively combine the movie feature variables, like runtime, director and actors to predict the user’s attitude. Having a rough idea of the movie's reputation, the company can improve the marketing strategy to increase the box office revenue.</p>

        Sept. 2016-Dec. 2016, Davis, CA
        <p>
        We aim to predict which products customers will purchase next month based on their behavior from past 1.5 years and their basic information. </p>

        <p>The data is big, approximately 10 gigabytes. We use four machine learning methods: logistic regression, SVM, random forest and XGBoost to solve the problem. Since the team consists of 15 members, it is separated into 4 sub-teams. Our sub-team focuses on using SVM method to establish a multiclass classifier. The accuracy of the final model is about 66%.

       <p>Our aim is to establish the average of consensus system in the field of bitcoin and blockchain. </p>
       <p>We collect news and public opinions about bitcoin, blockchain and digital assets through web scraping with Python. Then we arrange and clean all the data with R and import them into a MySQL database.</p>
       <p>Moreover, we conduct text mining, construct statistical language models and machine learning methods to analyze the correlation between public sentiment and the price of bitcoin. Finally, we find it exists strong correlation between public sentiment and the price of bitcoin.</p>
